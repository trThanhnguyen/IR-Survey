# Inverse Rendering - A Comparative Survey

This is our survey on a longstanding Computer Vision and Computer Graphics problem: **Inverse Rendering**. This survey also is the product of our final project in the 2024F Computer Vision course (515619電腦視覺) taught by professor Wei-Chen Chiu (邱維辰) at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taiwan.

To our knowledge, the last published survey was done by [Patow et. al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8659.2003.00716.x), dating back to 2003. Thus, there is a clear need for a modern review of this field. Furthermore,  Our study of computer vision fundamentals has revealed numerous recent advances - from differentiable rendering to neural radiance fields - that warrant systematic analysis. This motivates us to synthesize these developments and their applications in solving the inverse rendering problem.
